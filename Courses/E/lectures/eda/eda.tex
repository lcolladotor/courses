  \frametitle{boxplots}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \Rfunction{boxplot} : A plotting method for generating
    Tukey's boxplots.
  \item Excellent for comparing location shifts of $k$ distributions
    of varying size.
  \item Assess skewness and spread of either of one or more distributions.
  \item Boxplots are often a much better summary of a distribution
    than are histograms as they do not suffer from either bandwidth
    choice or the need to have large data sets.
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{example}
    What does skewness look like on a boxplot, spread? can we generate
    some data to exemplify these things? (hint: remember all of the
    random number generators which we talked about in the first lecture)
  \end{example}
