Experiment Description	siRNA transfection using either two different siRNAs targeting PROX1 or GFP

Protocol Description	Total RNA was isolated and DNAseI treated in RNeasy columns (Qiagen) according to manufacturers recommendations<br>(Parameters: Extracted product = total_RNA, Amplification = none)	For the analysis of gene expression after PROX1 knockdown, SW480R cells were transfected with 20nM PROX1 siRNA A16, A25, GFP siRNA A18 or, total RNA was isolated 48 h later from two biological replicates and processed for array hybridization	Cells cultured at +37 in 5% CO2, culture medium RPMI-1640 containing 10%     FCS (heat inactivated), 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml)<br><br><br>(Parameters: time unit = seconds, min temperature = 37, temperature unit = C, media = RPMI-1640)				Cell Intensity Files (CEL) and Chip files (CHP) were generated from images of the scanned probe arrays using Affymetrix Gene Chip Operating Software  (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the default settings recommended by the manufacturer. Hybridisation performance of the arrays was assessed using the R software, version 2.4.1, freely available from http://www.r-project.org/. CEL files were imported into R and various functions included in the affy, simpleaffy, affyPLM and affyQCReport packages were used to verify absence of anomalies in the data registered for the spike-in controls probes, the cross-species hybridization control probes and the housekeeping probe controls. Quality control metrics were also computed in order to assess the presence of spatial artifacts, RNA degradation or more general outlier behavior for any array. Further analysis of the data was done using various functions of the R packages affy and limma and separate analyses were performed for the two different siRNA:s with respect to controls. First, raw data from CEL files were normalized by application of the GC-RMA algorithm (Wu and Irizarry, 2006) with default settings. Information on detection calls, available from the CHP files, were then used for excluding less reliable data by requiring a present call in all arrays included in each of the two separate comparisons between siRNA treated samples and controls. To prevent exclusion of data pertaining to potentially interesting genes completely inactivated in one of the experiment conditions, genes called absent or marginal in all siRNA samples, while present in the controls, or vice-versa, were also included.<br><br><br><br>Zhijin Wu, Rafael A.
