\begin{abstract}
With the following exercises you'll tune your skills with packages such as biomaRt that enable you to download public data sets.
\end{abstract}

\section{biomaRt}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Use \pl{biomaRt} to access Uniprot. Get all the proteins from the virus domain. Find out which is the most frequent organism. Then find which is the most frequent EC number.
  \item Follow \url{www.ensembl.org/info/website/tutorials/biomart_worked_ex.pdf} and reproduce it using \pl{biomaRt}. Every time they mention "click result" you need to create a different object with the corresponding information.
  \item Make any plot you want with the previous data. Don't use the base plotting functions. Meaning, use \pl{lattice}, \pl{plotrix}, \ldots
  \end{enumerate}
